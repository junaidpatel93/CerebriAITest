# AngularDemoApp
This project is developed to help the QA in interview process.

## Requirements
* Chrome version: **77(preferable)**
* Typescript: **2.8.0+**

## Installation
Just running **npm install** should work

## Running the tests
Command to run the test: **ng e2e**
The test basically validates all the input fields and checks the output if all the fields are validated and submit button is pressed. 
Every field has been tested in the scripts.

## Acknowledgement
Gender input field was not working and breaking the whole system as it wasn't initialized in the form control. I fixed it so that the system works fine and the output is as expected.
Added 'name' and 'id' for the html tags so that I could use them for the e2e tests.
